    <div class="row">

            <h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<p>Live lecture will take place 11:00am-12:30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays over Zoom. Lectures will be recorded, and linked on Piazza/Website once lecture is over. It is highly recommended that you watch lecture the day it is released.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>
<p>We will use Piazza as the ‘one-stop shop’ throughout the semester: for a Q&amp;A forum and for official announcements. Enrollment in Piazza is mandatory. If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the instructors or TAs. Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it’s due. See the Piazza Etiquette section for more on using Piazza. To join the class on Piazza, click this.</p>
<h3 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h3>
<p>All homework and vitamins will be submitted through Gradescope, and all homework, vitamin, and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. If you have not been enrolled in our Gradescope, please fill out this form.</p>

<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<p>Please use Piazza for all technical questions. 
If you have a more specific administrative question or any feedback, please send email to the course administrative account fa21@eecs70.org (read by instructors and head TAs only).</p>

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>We will have one midterm and one final, dates listed below. 
We will offer both a proctored online and in-person option for the exam. 
In HW0 you will be asked to choose on of the two options to take your exam (either online or in-person). <strong>You will NOT be allowed to change your choice.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to large enrollment, we are unable to accommodate final exam conflicts with other classes; we strongly discourage enrollment in another class with conflicting lectures and/or final exam; if you choose to enroll in such a class you will have to make arrangements for an alternate Final with the other class.</p>

<p>Dates: XXX</p>

<h2 id="exam-attendance-policy">Exam Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>You must attend all exams in order to pass the class. We will consider granting an incomplete given extenuating circumstances that are communicated to course staff. Simply not attending the final exam does not ensure an automatic failure or the granting of an incomplete.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>There is no textbook for this class. Instead, there is a set of comprehensive lecture notes. Make sure you revisit the notes after every lecture. Each note may be covered in one or more lectures.
Former TA extraordinaire Megan says, “When I took the course, I studied the notes until I was able to comfortably reproduce all of the proofs.</p>

<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>
<p>Release Schedule: Discussion worksheets are published the night before. The solutions are published after all sections of the day are completed.</p>

<p>Discussions will be offered online and in-person. You will not be able to switch sections.</p>

<p>We will be assigning sections this semester (form to sign up is on Piazza), and attendance will be taken as part of your grade (through a completely objective criteria). You will receive 1 attendance point for every discussion, and will need at least 13 points in order to receive full credit for discussion attendance. You are welcome to attend other discussion sections, but your attendance will only be counted for the section you are actually assigned. The discussion sections are designed not to cover new material but to consolidate the material covered in lectures and in the notes. All sections are equivalent: they all cover the same material.</p>

<p>Lili says, “When I took the course, I tried my best to attend every discussion and ask questions whenever I was confused!”</p>

<h3 id="vitamins">Vitamins</h3>
<p>Release Schedule: The vitamin for the current week is released on Gradescope on Monday by 10:00 am. The vitamin is due on Gradescope the following Friday at 10:00 pm (grace period until Friday midnight); the solutions for that vitamin will be released on Saturday.</p>

<p>There will be weekly required vitamins designed to consolidate your understanding of the course material. If you read the notes in advance and attend lecture, they should be quick to complete. As a result, there will be no Piazza support for vitamins. Your final grade will be out of 73%, and your lowest three vitamin scores will be dropped, but this drop should be reserved for emergencies. No additional allowances will be made for late or missed vitamins: please do not contact us about missed vitamins or late submissions.</p>

<h4 id="vitamin-submission">Vitamin Submission</h4>
<p>Vitamins are due on Friday night at 10:00 PM. You need to submit your answers directly on Gradescope. If you have questions on how to do this, please make a private post on Piazza.</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>We encourage participation. Participation includes watching lecture live, contributing in discussion, asking and answering questions on Piazza, using Party OH, and more. The more you engage with the class, the more fun it is and the better you do.</p>
