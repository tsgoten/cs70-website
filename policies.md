## Lectures
Live lecture will take place 12:30pm-2pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays over Zoom. Lectures will be recorded, and linked on Piazza once lecture is over. It is highly recommended that you watch lecture the day it is released.

## Technology
### Piazza
We will use Piazza as the 'one-stop shop' throughout the semester: for a Q&A forum and for official announcements. Enrollment in Piazza is mandatory. If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the instructors or TAs. Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. We always welcome any feedback on what we could be doing better. See the Piazza Etiquette section for more on using Piazza. To join the class on Piazza, click this.
### Gradescope
All homework and vitamins will be submitted through Gradescope, and all homework, vitamin, and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. If you have not been enrolled in our Gradescope, please fill out this form.

### Email
Please use Piazza for all technical questions, and also all administrative questions about the course that are not personal to you: other students may also benefit from seeing the answers to these questions. If you have a more specific administrative question that relates to you alone, please either use a private post on Piazza (visible to course staff only) or send email to the course administrative account sp21@eecs70.org (read by instructors and head TAs only).
### Office Hours
Office hours will be hosted at oh.eecs70.org. There are two options available on this platform.
#### Party
At any time of any day, you can create a group for a question you are working on. Specify the assignment and question you’re working on and select “online” for location. Enter your own video call link - other students can join this group to work together on the same problem. You should look to see if someone else has already started a group for the problem you are working on, and join that group if so.
#### Queue
At the following times, course staff will be monitoring the online queue - TBA. Anyone in a “Party” group may hit “Ask for Help (as a group)” to submit their group to the queue. A course staff member will join the video call listed on the group when they help you. Alternatively, you can submit an individual ticket to the queue. Follow the same protocol as party group creation (question, location, zoom link).

## Exams
We will have one midterm and one final, dates listed below. There will be a remote proctoring component and will proceed under a version similar to what was done in the Fall. Unfortunately, due to large enrollment, we are unable to accommodate final exam conflicts with other classes; we strongly discourage enrollment in another class with conflicting lectures and/or final exam; if you choose to enroll in such a class you will have to make arrangements for an alternate Final with the other class. Details will be announced after the first week of classes.

Midterm date: Thursday, March 11th from 7-9PM PST

Final date: Thursday, May 13 from 3-6PM PST

### Exam Attendance Policy
You must attend all exams in order to pass the class. We will consider granting an incomplete given extenuating circumstances that are communicated to course staff. Simply not attending the final exam does not ensure an automatic failure or the granting of an incomplete.

### Exam Administration Policy
We will proceed under a remote exam procedure based on what was piloted in the summer. Our goal is to as much as possible to approximate what students would reasonably expect from an analogous in person exam. Exam administration details are pending finalization; they will be released after the first week of class and students will have the opportunity to drop the class if they are unable or unwilling to satisfy the necessary requirements.

## Materials
All materials can be found on the front page.

### Notes
There is no textbook for this class. Instead, there is a set of comprehensive lecture notes. Make sure you revisit the notes after every lecture. Each note may be covered in one or more lectures.

Megan says, “When I took the course, I studied the notes until I was able to comfortably reproduce all of the proofs.


### Discussions
We will be assigning sections this semester (form to sign up is on Piazza), and attendance will be taken as part of your grade (through a completely objective criteria). You will receive 1 attendance point for every discussion, and will need at least 13 points in order to receive full credit for discussion attendance. You are welcome to attend other discussion sections, but your attendance will only be counted for the section you are actually assigned. The discussion sections are designed not to cover new material but to consolidate the material covered in lectures and in the notes. All sections are equivalent: they all cover the same material.

Lili says, “When I took the course, I tried my best to attend every discussion and ask questions whenever I was confused. Take advantage of breakout rooms to ask questions to TA’s and AI’s in a smaller setting!"


### Vitamins
There will be weekly required vitamins designed to consolidate your understanding of the course material. If you read the notes in advance and attend lecture, they should be quick to complete. As a result, there will be no Piazza support for vitamins. Your final grade will be out of 73%, and your lowest three vitamin scores will be dropped, but this drop should be reserved for emergencies. No additional allowances will be made for late or missed vitamins: please do not contact us about missed vitamins or late submissions.


### Participation
We encourage participation. Participation includes watching lecture live, contributing in discussion, asking and answering questions on Piazza, using Party OH, and more. The more you engage with the class, the more fun it is and the better you do.

### Homeworks
There will be weekly required homeworks designed to consolidate your understanding of the course material. We strongly recommend starting these early since there will be no office hours support on weekends. Maximum credit for each homework will be given for any score of 73% or more. Your lowest three homework scores will be dropped, but this drop should be reserved for emergencies. No additional allowances will be made for late or missed homeworks: please do not contact us about missed homeworks or late submissions.

Due to budget constraints, we didn’t receive the same reader budget as we have in the past; so, we may sample homework problems to grade each week.

Richard recommends that you start the homeworks as early as possible so you get more time to think about the problems and get help if you end up getting stuck. Additionally, Richard also recommends that you carefully review the homework solutions after they are released and understand them to the point of being able to replicate them without needing to reference them. Having a comprehensive understanding of topics on the homework will go a long way in giving you the intuition you need to succeed!

#### Homework Submission
Homeworks are due on Friday night at 10:00 PM. You need to turn in a .pdf file consisting of your written-up solutions; you may use your phone camera or any page-scanning app in order to turn your written homework into a PDF, as long as your work is clear and legible. In addition, Gradescope has an option to associate pages of your work to each homework problem. You must select the relevant pages for every problem. Any problems without pages selected will receive zero credit. If you have any questions about the format of a homework submission, please go to appointments or homework party.
