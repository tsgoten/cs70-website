You're welcome to produce your homework PDF in various ways: $$\LaTeX$$, some other word processor, or neatly handwriting and scanning. We strongly advise using LaTeX. Here's why:

*   LaTeX documents are beautiful and a joy to read.
*   LaTeX is ubiquitous across mathematics and the sciences, so learning it is a sound investment.
*   Many past CS 70 readers believe that LaTeXed solutions tend to be correct more often.
*   CS70 is typically the class where students take time to learn LaTeX, which is a valuable skill to have.

General Homework template: [homework_template.tex]({% link assets/misc/homework_template.tex %}) 

To get started, you'll need a LaTeX editor, on which you write LaTeX code and compile it to PDF:

*   **(Recommended)** If you want to avoid local installation, try [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). You can [register with your Berkeley email](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/berkeley) to get a free Professional account.
*   If you want to write and compile on your own local machine, [LaTeX Wiki/Installation](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation) has installation instructions.

Now, to start creating LaTeX documents using your editor:

*   [LaTeX Wiki/Basics](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics) provides gentle introductions and minimal examples.
*   Find out how to write any symbol in LaTeX using [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) or [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/).

Here are some tutorials that cover the most basic to slightly advanced LaTeX:

*   [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-3](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-3)

If you get stuck, StackOverflow may be one of your best friends. Have fun $$\LaTeX$$ing!
