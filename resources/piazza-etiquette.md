* **Search before posting**: Sometimes your question may have already been answered by us or other students in the past. This gives us more time to answer new questions. Also you will avoid having us link to another post as an answer.
* **Link _and_ screenshot any external resources you are referring to (exams, discussion, stackoverflow, lecture slides + webcast time/video)**: It is more convenient for us and other students to look at the screenshot and follow the link if we need more context on the question. It will also substantially decrease the time it takes for us to answer your question. Also, you probably have whatever you are referring to opened already.
* **Try to avoid too open-ended/vague questions** such as: "How does BFS work?" or "How come the solution to a discussion problem is this?" or “How does this proof from the textbook work?” This keeps us guessing on what you are really stuck on. If you walk us through your thoughts and reference specific lines that you find confusing, we can better address the problem you are facing. It may even help us uncover any misunderstandings that you may have.
* **Please try to post homework questions publicly as follow-ups on the appropriate question threads whenever possible.** If your question is too detailed/revealing to fit there, that's a sign that your question is better answered during office hours. We do not have the bandwidth to pre-grade answers on Piazza, so detailed private HW questions are discouraged.
* **You should only post in the “Student Answer” box if you are fairly certain about your answer.** Do not post follow up questions or +1 in the student answer. Posting in the “Student Answer” section marks a post as resolved and will likely be missed. Use “Follow ups” to follow up while leaving the overall post unresolved.
* **If you want a reply on a follow up, mark it as unresolved**, or we may not see it.
* **If you reply to a follow up answering the question at hand, mark the follow up as resolved** since it no longer requires attention.
* **If you don’t seem to understand the given responses to your question, come to OH and mark your question as a conceptual question when putting yourself on the queue.** Conceptual questions, which are questions on discussions, past homeworks, concepts (ie from the textbook or lectures) and this semester’s exams get priority over homework questions. It is sometimes much easier to explain questions in a one on one setting where staff can articulate their points through illustrations.

## Piazza Etiquette

### Piazza Notes

We will encourage more student participation on Piazza rather than answering right away, that is, we will wait until other students step up and answer questions.

Of course, we will still provide clarifications on logistics, typos, subtle points, etc.

We want to make sure that you are helping each other out, and having instructors give away the answers isn't the most beneficial for your education either.

### 1. Ask HW questions only in HW posts

We've created individual posts for each problem from homework. Please ask questions, discuss problems, or help out in those posts only. Before asking a question, read through (or search) the whole post to see if your question has been answered.

### 2. Don't post answers in Piazza

Please don't give away the answer on Piazza. You can explain things in a way that still lets other students figure out the essence of the problem on their own, but don't spoil the problem. For example, don't point to a useful YouTube link that works out essentially what the problem is asking about.

### 3. Try to make posts public

While not violating Rule 2, try to make your questions public, because others might have the same question and we don't need to answer them multiple times.

### 4. Piazza is not OH. 5 minute-test

If you think your questions may take more than 5 minutes to answer, please come to office hours or homework parties instead.

### 5. Neither Piazza nor TAs are for pre-grading

Please do not post questions of the form:

- "Is this the correct solution to HW X problem Y?"
- "Would this receive full credit on HW X problem Y?"
- "Is this the right level of detail for HW X problem Y?"

Please do not use Piazza as a medium to ask instructors to check your homework in advance. We simply cannot check every student's homework through Piazza.

Feel free to ask questions of clarification, or ask questions about the course content to achieve a deeper understanding, but at a certain point, you must apply your knowledge, give it your best shot, and submit your answers with confidence.

### 6. Post a screenshot of any resource referenced

Your question should be self-contained. The TAs (and other responders) should not have to scan through PDFs to even figure out what the question is. Ask yourself: am I referring to some lecture slide/lecture note/HW solution/discussion solution/past exam?

If the answer is yes, post a screenshot of the relevant part.

### 7. Complaints / suggestions on course policies

**Please email these concerns to sp22@eecs70.org. Piazza is reserved for content questions and clarifications.
**

### 8. Post all your

Don't post one line saying:
> At step n, I get XYZ, and I'm now confused.

This forces the TAs to guess:
> What happened in steps 1, 2, ..., n - 1?

Most likely, the TAs will guess wrong, and we run into a mess of followup questions trying to figure out what steps 1, 2, ..., n - 1 were.

Instead, post:

>Starting out, we have: ....
>Then, I do ..., and I get ...
>Next, I do ..., and I get ...
>Next, I do ..., and I get ...
>Now, I get $&%&#(, and this makes no sense.

Then, the TA can respond:

> The mistake is at step 3, you're not allowed to apply ABC to XYZ because ...
