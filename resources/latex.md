You're welcome to produce your homework PDF in various ways: $$\LaTeX$$, some other word processor, or neatly handwriting and scanning. We strongly advise using LaTeX. Here's why:

*   LaTeX documents are beautiful and a joy to read.
*   LaTeX is ubiquitous across mathematics and the sciences, so learning it is a sound investment.
*   Many past CS 170 readers believe that LaTeXed solutions tend to be correct more often.
*   CS170 is typically the class where students take time to learn LaTeX, which is a valuable skill to have.

General Homework template: [homework_template.tex]({% link assets/misc/homework_template.tex %}) 

> If you would like fancier style, use the [cs170.sty file]({% link assets/misc/cs170.sty %}). You can just include it as the same folder as your TeX file and include the line `\usepackage{cs170}`.

To get started, you'll need a LaTeX editor, on which you write LaTeX code and compile it to PDF:

*   If you want to write and compile on your own local machine, [LaTeX Wiki/Installation](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation) have installation instructions.
*   If you want to avoid local installation, try [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). [Register with your Berkeley email](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/berkeley) to get a free Professional account.

Now, to start creating LaTeX documents using your editor:

*   [LaTeX Wiki/Basics](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics) provides gentle introductions and minimal examples.
*   Find out how to write any symbol in LaTeX using [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) or [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/).

Alternatively, [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/Home) is a version of LaTeX with a GUI. It feels more like the "what you see is what you get" experience of a traditional word processor, while still producing the same beautiful output as raw LaTeX. Here are some tutorials that cover the most basic to slightly advanced LaTeX:

*   [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-2](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-2)
*   [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-3](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-3)

If you get stuck, StackOverflow may be one of your best friends. If you know of other helpful guides or resources, post those too. Happy $$\LaTeX$$ing!
