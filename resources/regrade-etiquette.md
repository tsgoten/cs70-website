title: Regrade Request Etiquette (homeworks and exams)

* Look at solutions first.
* Submit regrade request for mis-applied rubric-items. Do not just ask for more points.
* If you make too many requests, we may regrade your entire homework or exam. However, if you have too many frivolous requests, we may ignore future requests.
* If you believe that you have a valid alternative solution, please post on piazza along with a proof of correctness on why you think your solution is correct. This will allow for other students who came up with similar solution to be able to see the instructor response to whether there is a flaw to the proof or not, or explain how the rubric was applied in that particular situation. Do note that we do consider alternative solutions very seriously.
* Keep in mind that we grade the entire question again, which means scores could go up or down.
