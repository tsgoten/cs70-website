bio: I'm an incoming second-year Ph.D. student in EECS interested in computational biology and machine learning. Before coming to Berkeley, I worked at the Broad Institute. I did my undergrad at Harvard, where I majored in (pure) math. Apart from research, I like to listen to music and practice guitar.
