bio: I'm a 2nd year PhD student in BAIR--I currently work on representation learning in computer vision and robotics. I did my undergrad in math, and I continue to enjoy bringing my math nerdiness into my CS research. Outside of work, I play piano (& attempt at music production), Smash, chess, and snowboard.
