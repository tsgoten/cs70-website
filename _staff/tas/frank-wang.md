bio: Hello! I'm a senior studying EECS and math from the Bay Area. This is my 3rd time TAing 70 but the first time I've had the chance to write a bio - I'm both nervous and excited! Outside of academics, I like Steph Curry, @foodieefrank, Lauv, running, airline meal desserts, the city of Berkeley, and chili oil.&nbsp;Academically, I like CS 70.
