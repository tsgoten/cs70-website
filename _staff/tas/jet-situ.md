bio: Hello! I'm a third-year EECS+Business major from the Houston area. I'm not a fan of staying in one place, so you might find me studying anywhere on campus from Haas to Soda. In my free time, I play table tennis and BeatSaber, and this year, I'm learning to play the koto. Let's make this semester the best yet!
