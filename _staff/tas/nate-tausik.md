bio: Hi! My name is Nate, and I'm a third year Math, Physics and CS major from Los Angeles. When not doing problem sets, I can often be found cooking, practicing guitar, or playing video games, so feel free to talk to me about any of these things! CS 70 is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Berkeley; it can be challenging, but it had big impact on how I view math and the world in general. My biggest hope is that you all will find the course fun and exciting, and enjoy it as much as I did!
