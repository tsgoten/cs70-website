bio: Hi! I'm a junior studying CS & History from Toronto. My hobbies include taking pictures of my cat, annoying my friends with said pictures, and buying 3 books for every 1 I read. I'm in the process of acquiring (1) more tactile switches and cute keycaps than I need and (2) *some* fluency in the French language. My favourite topic is graph theory because I can draw pretty diagrams :D
