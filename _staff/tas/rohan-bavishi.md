bio: Hey there! I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department, researching automated code-writing techniques. This is my first time teaching CS70, so super excited! In my free time, I love to play, and design, video games (highly recommend Celeste, Baba is You, and Katana Zero!), read and practice the piano. Feel free to reach out to talk about anything, especially if it's about grad school as I have accumulated quite a few years of experience! Cheers!
